Overexpression of this protein is usually associated with the occurrence and progression of aggressive types of breast cancer.

(1,2);) The difference between the LoD in buffer and diluted serum suggests that some of the serum components (could be endogenous sHER2) are likely to interfere with the sensor surface. Therefore, to differentiate the interference signal, the fiber was first stabilized in diluted serum, after which the known sHER concentrations in diluted serum were [...] performance for the detection of the breast cancer biomarker HER2. The immobilization of the antibody was achieved by silane coupling surface chemistry. The sensor exhibited a concentration-dependent response to increasing concentrations of sHER2 from 3 ag/mL to 128 ng/mL, with the lowest experimental detection threshold reported so far for sHER2. In addition to their small size and increased sensitivity, the fabrication of the TFBG–ball resonator sensors was relatively easy and robust. The",

Thus, sHER2 ECD has been proposed as a promising biomarker for cancer recurrence and for monitoring the disease status of patients overexpressing HER2.

The addition of this targeted therapy makes it even more important for patients to seek care from a center of excellence like MD Anderson that can perform precise testing.

Now, thanks to more detailed testing, there’s a name for HER2 levels between 1-2: HER2 low.\n\nA score of zero is called HER2 negative. If the IHC score is 2, then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing is needed to determine if HER2 is positive or negative.
